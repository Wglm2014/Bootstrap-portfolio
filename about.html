                <h4>Wilson earned a degree in computer science and business administration years
                    ago,
                    but has
                    never stopped his professional or personal education. He is a deep thinker and perpetual
                    learner who relishes
                    studying everything from math to cello to Italian, and thrives on sharing his knowledge
                    with others. Generous with his time and his experience, Wilson has always enjoyed tutoring
                    fellow classmates whether in math, language, music or sports. He is as comfortable picking
                    up the material independently as he is working on a team.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Raised in El Salvador, he played soccer before he started kindergarten and has always
                    enjoyed being part of a team, knowing when to kick the ball for the goal and when to pass to a
                    teammate in a better position. Anticipating where his skills are most needed and being
                    flexible to respond to that need are some of Wilsonâ€™s strengths, in addition to his sensitivity
                    and openness to learn about others. Though he enjoys studying a broad range of subjects
                    and activities, when he is working on something he strives to deliver exactly what his
                    audience craves, whether it is a nimble app, a delicious Boston cream pie, or an evocative
                    drawing.
