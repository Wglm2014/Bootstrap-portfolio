                    <h4>Hello I am Wilson Linares, I would like to work as a Full Stack Web App developer. I am
                        currently half the way of a Coding Bootcamp at Harvard Extension School, provided by Trilogy
                        Education Services, the skills already learn are HTML, CSS, Javascript including JQuery, and
                        Bootstrap for the Front End and Node.js, Express and MySql for the back Back End. Also I have
                        learn java 8 advance level and JEE 8 (jsp, jsf, jpa, ejb, etc) working with Eclipse Studying
                        online courses in Udemy.com and Pluralsight.com.
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        Before graduating in Computer Science and Business Administration, I started gaining experience
                        in IT Services and System Analysis and Software Development, first as a free lancer, then
                        working for Public and Private Companies. All this during the time when foxPro, document base
                        data bases and Novel LANs were popular, then working in the migration of software developed to
                        run in the command line to a Graphic enviroment, using Developer 2000 and 6.0 (forms and
                        reports) SQL, Pl/SQL over Oracle DB, all Oracle technologies.
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        I have always enjoy being part of a team, either in sports playing soccer, at school working on
                        projects or at work producing useful programs. Open to share my skills with my team mates and
                        learn from them, give support when necesary to always meet deadlines, being flexible,
                        friendly and with a good attitud. <br>As and individual I love to permanently
                        learn a broad range of subjects and explore activities, but when working on a project I strive
                        to deliver exactly what it is expected, wheather is an App, a delicious dish or an evocative
                        craft. I'm very observative and sensitive, of circunstances and people, that helps me to take
                        good descicions or respect and consider the people I'm around. And last I like to think deep to
                        have a good conception of personal ideas and of the others, I believe in a good society and
                        good life!
