                    <h4>Wilson earned a degree in computer science and business administration years
                        ago,
                        but has
                        never stopped his professional or personal education. He is a deep thinker and perpetual
                        learner who relishes
                        studying everything from math to cello to Italian, and thrives on sharing his knowledge
                        with others. Generous with his time and his experience, Wilson has always enjoyed tutoring
                        fellow classmates whether in math, language, music or sports. He is as comfortable picking
                        up the material independently as he is working on a team.
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        Raised in El Salvador, he played soccer before he started kindergarten and has always
                        enjoyed being part of a team, knowing when to kick the ball for the goal and when to pass to a
                        teammate in a better position. Anticipating where his skills are most needed and being
                        flexible to respond to that need are some of Wilsonâ€™s strengths, in addition to his sensitivity
                        and openness to learn about others. Though he enjoys studying a broad range of subjects
                        and activities, when he is working on something he strives to deliver exactly what his
                        audience craves, whether it is a nimble app, a delicious Boston cream pie, or an evocative
                        drawing.
